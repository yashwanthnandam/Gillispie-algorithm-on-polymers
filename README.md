# Gillispie algorithm on polymers
We are studying the kinetics and thermodynamics[3] of reversible polymerization[4], with two types of monomer species, conserving to total no. of monomers. The chemical kinetics of the reactions are derived using rate equation and mass-action law. Initially, we consider a non-equilibrium closed system and observe that it attains an equilibrium condition dynamically. We study the time evolution of such system considering that all possible reactions has some random nature and the molecules reacts as a whole and canâ€™t react partially. We are using Gillespie algorithm[1] to perform simulations on the system. We are first studying the case where only one type of monomer is present, then we would move on to the case where two types of monomer are present in the system. This procedure is used in studying the metabolism of carbohydrates in bacteria. This type of approach can also be applied to study various other systems where the system exhibit randomness in its dynamic behaviour, for example, it can be applied to study the evolution of wealth distribution[2] in a community and it can also be used to study how does a rumour propagate.
